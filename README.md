# Assignment 1: RESTFUL service
This project implements a URL shortening service using the Flask web framework in Python. 

## Run the project

Navigate to the project directory  and execute the following command

```python
python -m flask --app app run
```

Flask will look for a module named `app` and run it as a Flask application. If everything is set up correctly, you should see the Flask development server start, and you can access your Flask application at the specified URL (usually `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` by default).
